The plugin asks commenters to write their names in the language that your blog uses.

== Description ==

The plugin asks commenters to write their names in the language that your blog uses. Using names written in your blog's native language will enhance the quality of users' conversation. Customizing predefined rules can create your own slang. Less spam is a welcome side effect.

= Translation =

The plugin comes with a set of predefined standards for every translated language.

* Finnish `fi` (by Christian Hellberg)
* German `de_DE`
* Hebrew `he_IL` (by [Yaron Shahrabani](https://edge.launchpad.net/~sh-yaron))
* Icelandic `is_IS` (by Hans Rúnar Snorrason) †
* Persian `fa_IR` (by [Alefba](http://alefba.us/)) †
* Russian `ru_RU`

= How can I translate the plugin in my native language? =

Download the [development version](http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/readable-names.zip). In there you will find the file `readable-names.pot`. Translate it with “[Poedit](http://www.poedit.net/)”. Contact me through the [support forum](http://wordpress.org/tags/readable-names). 

= What is the value of the plugin? =

You cannot read foreign alphabet characters. “Доктор Бро” is just not readable for you, if you don't know Russian. Strangers who want to leave comments on *your* blog, have to speak *your* language. The commenter is always the guest.

== Screenshots ==

1. The admin option page is clear.

2. The comment form gives a decent hint.

3. The error messages are user friendly.
