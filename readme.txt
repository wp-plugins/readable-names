Asks commenters to write their names in the language that your blog uses.

== Description ==

This plugin asks commenters to write their names in the language that your blog uses. Using readable names written in your blog's native language will enhance the discussion. Strangers who want to leave comments on *your* blog, have to speak *your* language.

Customizing predefined rules can create your own slang.

Less spam is a welcome side effect on non-Latin alphabets.

= Translations =

The plugin comes with a set of predefined standards for every translated language.

* Finnish `fi` (by Christian Hellberg)
* German `de_DE`
* Hebrew `he_IL` (by [Yaron Shahrabani](https://edge.launchpad.net/~sh-yaron))

* Russian `ru_RU`

Please use the [support forum](http://wordpress.org/tags/readable-names)
for problems or questions with this plugin. “Readable Names” topics must be
tagged with `readable-names`.

Support questions by email will be ignored.

= How can I translate the plugin in my native language? =

* Download the [development version](http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/readable-names.zip).
* Find the file `readable-names.pot` inside the subfolder `languages`.
* Translate it with the free editor “[Poedit](http://www.poedit.net/)”.
* Contact me through the dedicated [support forum](http://wordpress.org/tags/readable-names). 

= Why should I forbid the use of any foreign alphabet? =

You cannot read foreign alphabet characters. “Доктор Бро” is just not readable
for you, if you don't speak Russian. Other commenters don't expect
foreign alphabets on your site at all.

= Could it happen that ordinary comments get lost? =

No, it's impossible. Comments with ordinary names pass through without any side effect.

== Screenshots ==

1. The comment form gives a decent hint.

2. The error messages are user friendly.

3. The count of unreadable attempts is displayed on the dashboard.

4. The admin option page is clear.

5. The plugin has been translated even into Russian.
